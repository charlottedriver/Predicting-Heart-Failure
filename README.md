# Predicting Mortality From Heart Failure

## Objective
The objective of this study is to create a model that predicts the survival of patients with heart failure. 
## Data
This dataset contains 12 features from 299 patients that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure. The patients consisted of 105 women and 194 men, and their ages range between 40 and 95 years old. 

## Acknowledgements
This dataset is from a study conducted by Chicco and Jurman (2020). In which they created a machine learning model that could predict the survival of patients with heart failure from serum and creatinine and ejection fraction alone. Not only can these two features accurately predict survival from heart failure, but these two features alone lead to more accurate predictions that the datasets features in its entirety.
